Netframe: 4.0.8
Template: Console App C# netFramework



In this part02 it still works the same as part one but not entirely the same so this is how my chatot works:

1) Run program the bots welcomes you then immediatetly starts the conversation with you as the user.

2) Captures the user’s name.

3) Handles user input in a loop.

4) Detects keywords like "password", "scam", "privacy", etc.

5) Uses generic collections (Dictionary, List) for organized responses.

6) Uses delegates to allow modular processing of topics.

7) Remembers the user’s name.

8) Responds with different styles based on user sentiment (worried, curious, frustrated).

9) Differentiates between Chatbot: and User: in output.

Categorized responses for topics like passwords, phishing, and safe browsing.

Random selection of a response from a List<string>.

Organized using a Dictionary<string, List<string>>
